Please run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I've focussed on clean, simple code. Could still do with some cleaning up.

I've taken some short cuts.

 - I haven't included quantities in the crates.
 - I haven't included a UI. Please see [here](http://connectivity-hub.placard-network.eu/) for an previous example.
 - It only functions through unit testing for the moment. `yarn test` or `npm test` to run them. Feel free to try to break it, I'm sure there's plenty of cases I haven't accounted for.

Hopefully it's still useful for assessment. Please see comments for plenty of todos etc.
